    <p>Have you ever seen a milkweed shedding its seeds in the fall? Or heard the ice on a lake singing? <br><br>  In a city, we tend to move fast. Sometimes we're in a rush, sometimes we're in our heads thinking or worrying, and sometimes instead of looking around, we busy our attention with the light of a smartphone. <br><br>  However, if we cultivate our attention, we can start to hear and see old things in new ways. We can start to see beyond scurrying to the subway or the titanic buildings. If we really look, we can start to even see beyond the human.</p>
